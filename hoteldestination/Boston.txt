Monday through Thursday evenings, there is a hosted wine hour in the Rooftop Retreat.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the amenities offered to provide a comfortable stay, great care was taken in selecting furniture and décor to provide an authentic experience. The American folk art theme is a tribute to both the local culture and Engine Co. 7, and adds another layer of intrigue to the culture-rich building.

Fascinating antiques, toys and fireman regalia are thoughtfully placed throughout the hotel and reference the history of early America.

Just steps from public transportation links and 1 easy exit off the I93, this Beacon Hill hotel is the perfect base from which to explore Boston.||In terms of hotel architecture, it is hard to imagine a more original design scenario than a Boston luxury hotel created from an iconic 19th-century jail. Built in 1851, the Charles Street Jail was thought to be one of the best examples of the ‘Boston Granite Style' of the mid-19th century. Recently renovated, the interior design reflects a passionate commitment to authenticity, while a more playful attitude defines its day-to-day style. Within the main building, there are 18 guest rooms, a grand ballroom and one of the city's hottest nightlife venues. Adjacent to a historical gallery of images and tales from the last 150 years, a 16-storey tower houses 280 guestrooms, enhanced by expansive views of Boston. Fully air-conditioned, the hotel also features a lobby, lift access, several restaurants, WLAN Internet access and room service.
