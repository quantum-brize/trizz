On the lower ground floor, you can challenge someone to a game of table tennis while you wait for your washing to dry in the laundromat. Instead of a big buffet breakfast, guests can buy whatever they like from the Barception, such as paninis, yoghurt, smoothies and delicious coffee! In short, you can look forward to a different kind of stay with us with plenty of innovative solutions! This is a hotel with smart solutions for those who don't want to waste their money on unnecessary fuss. This means that there are no expensive services like room service or a minibar in the room. Instead, you'll find loads of snacks, food and drink in our lobby shop open 24\/7. We also do our best to reduce the impact on the environment; you'll notice this when you get here. That's why we've done away with the hotel restaurant and why we don't wash towels and bedding every day. The Comfort Hotel Xpress Youngstorget has a gym with equipment to improve both stamina and strength. Open 24\/7, so you can exercise whenever you want. We offer 241 trendy hotel rooms. The rooms are compact, with cool colours and trendy furniture. You will always have a clean and tidy room when you arrive. But, in order to be an even more affordable hotel option in Oslo, the rooms are only cleaned every four days if you stay more than one night. You are welcome to come by the Barception if you feel like you need new towels and we are more than happy to come and clean your room in-between, for a small fee. Come by and we'll tell you more!
